 Created a WebApp with ML API (Clarifai API) to detect faces from images.                                                                                  
 Used React.js in Front End for Creating the UI and Client Side Rendering.                                                                                          
 For server-side rendering, I used Node.js and Express.js while I used Clarifai API for Detecting Face.                                                            
 Used PostgreSQL as a Database to do Login Checks and iterate through emails and passwords.
